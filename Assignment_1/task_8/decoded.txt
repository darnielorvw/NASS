there is an art it says or rather a knack to flying the knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss pick a nice day the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy suggests and try it the first part is easy all it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight and the willingness not to mind that its going to hurt that is its going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground most people fail to miss the ground and if they are really trying properly the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard clearly it is the second part the missing which presents the difficulties one problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally its no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you wont you have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else when youre halfway there so that you are no longer thinking about falling or about the ground or about how much its going to hurt if you fail to miss it it is notoriously difficult to prize your attention away from these three things during the split second you have at your disposal hence most peoples failure and their eventual disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport if however you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by say a gorgeous pair of legs or a bomb going off in your vicinty or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner this is a moment for superb and delicate concentration bob and float float and bob ignore all consideration of your own weight simply let yourself waft higher do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful they are most likely to say something along the lines of good god you cant possibly be flying it is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right waft higher and higher try a few swoops gentle ones at first then drift above the treetops breathing regularly do not wave at anybody  when you have done this a few times you will find the moment of distraction rapidly easier and easier to achieve  you will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your flight your speed your maneuverability and the trick usually lies in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do but just allowing it to happen as if it were going to anyway  you will also learn about how to land properly which is something you will almost certainly screw up and screw up badly on your first attempt  there are private clubs you can join which help you achieve the allimportant moment of distraction they hire people with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and exhibit and or explain them at the critical moments few genuine hitchhikers will be able to afford to join these clubs but some may be able to get temporary employment at them
